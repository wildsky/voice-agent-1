Model Optimization
Use smaller Whisper models ("tiny" or "base" instead of "medium" or "large")
Cache the Whisper model in memory rather than loading it each time
Use faster OpenAI models like GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4 when appropriate
Audio Processing
Optimize audio conversion with PyDub by using smaller sample rates
Implement audio streaming for ElevenLabs TTS instead of waiting for full file
Add temporary file cleanup to prevent disk I/O bottlenecks
Response Handling
Implement asynchronous parallel processing using FastAPI's native async support
Add caching for frequent responses
Use connection pooling for API calls
Code Implementation
For model pre-loading:

python
CopyInsert
# Move this outside of the endpoint function
model = whisper.load_model("tiny")  # Use smaller model
For parallel processing:

python
CopyInsert
async def talk(audio: UploadFile = File(...)) -> dict:
    # Process audio in a separate thread pool
    audio_data = await asyncio.to_thread(process_audio, audio)
    
    # Make API calls concurrently
    transcription_task = asyncio.create_task(transcribe_audio(audio_data))
    
    # Continue processing while transcription happens
    transcription = await transcription_task
For response caching:

python
CopyInsert
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def generate_response(text: str) -> str:
    # This will cache responses for identical inputs
    return openai.chat.completions.create(...)
These improvements could significantly reduce the end-to-end latency of your voice application without major architectural changes [Rule: Write concise, technical Python code].
